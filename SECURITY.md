## Supported Versions

This table contains the versions and their support status.<br>
If a version is not supported, it means it might have some vulnerabilities
which won't be fixed.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.0     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The most efficient way to report a vulnerability is by opening a pull request<br>
with the fix for that vulnerability, or if there's no fix yet, open an issue<br>
explaining the vulnerability and the dependency affected by it.

Usually vulnerability updates won't take much time, as soon as there's a fix for it<br>
KarmaAPI will try to update to fix those vulnerabilities.
